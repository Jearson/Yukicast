1. udp ports do need to be bind()'ed after socket() to begin reading data on them
2. you can read(), recv(), recvfrom() a UDP socket after it is established. The only
difference between ithat read() is more general (sockets == file descriptors)),
recv() allows you to specify options, and recvfrom() can also return information about
the UDP sender.
3. when you copy code from one function to another, and work from there, you incur a 
certain risk of feeling really, really dumb afterwards. (i.e. in udp_bind() where I
broke out of the loop before the socket() was bound)
